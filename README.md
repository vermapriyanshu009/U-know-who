# U-know-who
This project uses the face_recognition library in Python for face recognition. It encodes known faces and compares them with unknown ones from images or real-time video, identifying and labeling matches. It's a simple and effective way to explore facial recognition technology.

# Working:
Use the simple_facerec.py file to use the face detection program.
Make a folder "Images" in the main folder, inside which you will be storing the images of the people/objects you want to recognise.
If any error persists regarding missing file(s), please check the repository. I have uplaoded all the necesaary files which you might not have.
